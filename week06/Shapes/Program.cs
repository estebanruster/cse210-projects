W06 Learning activity: Polymorphism
.
Polymorphism is build upon the other three principles of programming with
classes: abstraction, encapsulation and inheritance. This program task is
to calculate the area of Shapes(Square, Rectangle and Circle). Each Shape
sould contain its _color and their dimensions; as well to calculate the
area with an aproriate behavior for each derived Shape class
(polimorphism principle).
